# Tesla Beat Saber Light Show Converter
Convert Beat Saber maps to Tesla light shows!

*This project requires FFMPEG and all packages from requirements.txt (Use "pip install -r requirements.txt")*

With the new Tesla software update a new light show feature has been added. This makes it possible to control the car lights timed with music. I however, am way too lazy to create my own light shows, so I coded a program to do it for me. As someone that has played a lot of the popular VR-game Beat Saber, I thought I could use those levels to generate a light show. This program works by taking the data from a Beat Saber level and translating it to the xLights format Tesla uses. The program is in very early stages, but I plan to build more features upon it.

 Check out the demo video:
